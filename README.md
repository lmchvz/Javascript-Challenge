# JavaScript Challenge 

## Project Description

The goal of the project was to visualize UFO Sighting Data by using HTML, Javascript, Bootstrap and the D3.js library.

A basic HTML web page was created using the UFO dataset in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, write code that appends a table to your web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

Make sure you have a column for date/time, city, state, country, shape, and comment at the very least.
Use a date form in your HTML document and write JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the date/time column to find rows that match user input.
